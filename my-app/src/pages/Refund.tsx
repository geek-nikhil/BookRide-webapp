  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Cancellations</h2>
  <p className="text-gray-700">
    We understand that plans can change, and we aim to accommodate cancellations in a fair manner. Please review the following cancellation terms:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700">
    <li>
      Cancellations made at least 24 hours before the scheduled pick-up or service time will receive a full refund, minus any applicable processing fees. This provides us with sufficient time to reallocate resources and offer the service to other customers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cancellations made within 24 hours of the scheduled pick-up or service time will incur a cancellation fee of 50% of the total amount paid. This is to compensate for the short notice and the opportunity cost associated with last-minute cancellations.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you fail to cancel and do not show up at the scheduled time, no refund will be issued. We encourage you to notify us as soon as possible in case of any changes to your plans to avoid this situation.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
    Please ensure to carefully review your booking details before confirming, as cancellations and refunds are subject to these terms.

<section className="mb-8">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Refunds</h2>
  <p className="text-gray-700">
    We are committed to ensuring customer satisfaction. Refunds will be processed according to the terms outlined in our cancellation policy. Please review the details below:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700">
    <li>
      Refunds for eligible cancellations will be processed back to the original payment method within 7-10 business days. Please note that it may take additional time for the refund to reflect depending on your payment provider.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the service provider is unable to fulfill the booking due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., vehicle breakdown, driver unavailability), we will issue a full refund or offer an alternative solution, such as rescheduling the service at no additional cost.
    </li>
    <li>
      If there is an issue with the service provided (e.g., driver cancellation, equipment failure, etc.), please notify us immediately. We will collaborate with you to find an appropriate resolution, which may include a refund, replacement service, or rescheduling based on the situation.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
    We strive to resolve all concerns promptly and fairly, ensuring that your experience with us is seamless.

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Non-refundable Services</h2>
  <p className="text-gray-700">
    Some services are considered non-refundable. The following types of services are excluded from refund eligibility:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700">
    <li>
      Prepaid services or special offers that clearly specify no refunds are available at the time of booking. This includes any promotions, discounts, or bundled offers that explicitly outline non-refundable terms.
    </li>
    <li>
      Services that have been rendered, in part or in full, such as partial ride services or completed bookings, even if the customer did not use the full service time or distance. Once the service has started or been partially consumed, no refund will be issued.
    </li>
    <li>
      Services provided in case of emergencies, where the customer agrees to the service in immediate need, may also be deemed non-refundable if completed.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
    We recommend reviewing the service details and terms before booking to ensure clarity on non-refundable conditions. Should you have any questions, please contact our support team for clarification.
