      <strong>Advance Payment Requirement:</strong> Full payment must be made in advance at the time of booking through our platform. This ensures commitment and reservation of a driver for the requested time slot.
    </li>

  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    DriversOnCall values your time and trust. We have designed our cancellation and refund policy to be transparent and fair, in accordance with Indian consumer protection standards under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 and digital payment norms prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
  </p>

  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">

      <strong>Client-Initiated Cancellations:</strong> Clients can cancel their bookings through the platform interface or by contacting customer support.
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">

          Cancellations made more than <strong>24 hours before the scheduled pick-up time</strong> are eligible for a full refund, after deduction of applicable <strong>transaction fees (typically 2-3%)</strong> charged by the payment gateway.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cancellations made <strong>within 24 hours</strong> of the scheduled service time are <strong>non-refundable</strong> due to driver allocation and commitment costs. However, clients may request to reschedule the service, subject to driver availability, without incurring any additional fees.

      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
        <li>A full refund to the original payment method, or</li>
        <li>Assignment of an alternate driver at no extra cost, based on client preference and availability</li>
      </ul>
      This is in line with the platformâ€™s commitment under the Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Refund Processing:</strong> Refunds will be processed within <strong>7 to 10 business days</strong> from the date of cancellation confirmation. Refunds will be initiated to the <strong>original mode of payment</strong> used at the time of booking.
      <br />
      In case of any delays beyond 10 working days, clients are encouraged to raise a support ticket through our help desk for expedited resolution.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Payment Gateway Fees:</strong> Transaction charges deducted by the payment processor at the time of booking are <strong>non-refundable</strong>. These typically range from 2% to 3% depending on the payment method and will be clearly mentioned on the invoice.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Force Majeure:</strong> In events beyond reasonable control (natural disasters, riots, technical failures, etc.), the platform reserves the right to reschedule or cancel services without liability. Refunds will be issued based on the nature of the disruption and mutual agreement.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Abuse of Refund Policy:</strong> Clients found repeatedly canceling or misusing the refund system may be temporarily or permanently suspended from using DriversOnCall as per our fair use policy.

    All drivers registered with DriversOnCall are considered independent contractors and are expected to uphold the highest standards of professionalism, safety, and compliance. The following responsibilities must be strictly adhered to in accordance with the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and other relevant regulations.
  </p>

  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
    <li>
      <strong>Valid Licensing and Documentation:</strong> Drivers must possess a valid and current driving license authorized by a Regional Transport Office (RTO) in India, appropriate to the class of vehicle operated. Drivers must also carry required documentation, including Aadhar, PAN, and police verification as mandated by the Motor Vehicle Aggregator Guidelines, 2020.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Vehicle Ownership and Maintenance:</strong> While DriversOnCall only connects clients with drivers (not vehicles), any vehicle operated under this service must be legally compliantâ€”insured, registered, and meeting emission standards (PUC). Vehicles must be well-maintained, clean, and in good operational condition.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Professional Conduct:</strong> Drivers must behave courteously and professionally with all clients. Harassment, misbehavior, discriminatory remarks, or refusal of service without valid reason is strictly prohibited and may result in suspension or permanent deactivation from the platform.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Punctuality and Communication:</strong> Drivers are expected to arrive on time at the designated pick-up location. In case of any delay due to unforeseen circumstances, the driver must immediately notify the client and/or the platform support team.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Compliance with Traffic Laws:</strong> Drivers must adhere to all applicable traffic rules and road safety regulations set by the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.

    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Data Privacy and Client Confidentiality:</strong> Drivers must maintain the privacy and confidentiality of client data, location, and travel plans. Any misuse or unauthorized disclosure of client information will result in strict disciplinary action.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Prohibition of Unauthorized Substitution:</strong> Only the registered driver assigned to a booking may perform the service. Transferring assignments to unregistered or unauthorized individuals is a violation of platform policy and may invite legal action.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Zero Tolerance for Misuse:</strong> Any attempt to solicit clients outside the platform, manipulate trip durations, overcharge, or falsify trip reports will be considered a breach of contract and may result in immediate termination and legal proceedings under Indian Contract Act, 1872.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Client Responsibilities</h2>
  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    To ensure a smooth, respectful, and legally compliant experience for all parties, clients engaging DriversOnCall services are expected to adhere to the following responsibilities. These responsibilities are in line with general contract obligations under the Indian Contract Act, 1872 and principles of ethical platform use.
  </p>

  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
    <li>
      <strong>Accurate Booking Information:</strong> Clients must provide complete and truthful information at the time of booking, including correct names, phone numbers, pick-up/drop-off addresses, time schedules, number of passengers, and any special requirements. Inaccurate or misleading information may result in delayed or failed services and may limit liability of the platform.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Timely Availability:</strong> Clients are expected to be ready at the specified pick-up time and location. DriversOnCall reserves the right to levy waiting charges or mark the ride as a no-show if the client delays unduly (typically beyond 10 minutes). Any rescheduling due to late arrival is subject to driver availability.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Respectful Conduct:</strong> Clients must treat the driver with dignity and respect throughout the ride. Any instance of verbal or physical abuse, harassment, discrimination, or unlawful behavior will lead to immediate suspension from the platform and may result in police intervention under applicable Indian Penal Code sections.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Vehicle Usage & Safety:</strong> As clients provide their own vehicles, they must ensure that the vehicle is safe, roadworthy, insured, and has all the required documents (RC, PUC, Insurance). Clients are solely responsible for any liabilities arising from defects in the vehicle.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Prohibited Activities:</strong> Clients shall not engage the driver in illegal, unsafe, or unauthorized activities including but not limited to overloading the vehicle, unlawful transportation of goods, or use of the driver for any criminal intent.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Feedback & Dispute Resolution:</strong> Clients should promptly report any service issue, misconduct, or breach of policy by the driver through the official support channel. Complaints must be raised within 24 hours of the booking to be considered valid for investigation.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Cancellation Courtesy:</strong> Clients are encouraged to cancel bookings responsibly and as early as possible if the service is no longer needed. Frequent or last-minute cancellations without valid reasons may affect future booking privileges.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Indemnification:</strong> The client agrees to indemnify and hold harmless DriversOnCall, its affiliates, and its contractors (including drivers) from any claims, losses, or legal disputes arising out of the misuse of the platform or clientâ€™s breach of these responsibilities.
